It contains all the interactions of users of Medscape and Univadis websites.
It won't provide any personal information about HCPs, only information about groups of HCPs (for GDPR reglementation).
Roche selects at least 50 HCPs, group them within a micro-cluster and submits it to Medscape through an API that Roche can query in real-time.
Roche can send an unlimited number of queries to the API (i.e. 10,000 queries per hours) with different micro-cluster composition
An API request on this endpoint will provide the distribution of the device used by the requested users, most interacted articles with title/URL, affinity (interest metric) for the selected group of HCPs, activity metrics for the requested users and distribution of the content type consumed by the requested users.","ANEMIA < 1111
